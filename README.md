This is a dashboard to analyze the **General Social Survey (GSS)** data that is a biennial survey conducted 
by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.  


## The General Social Survey (GSS)    

The **General Social Survey (GSS)** is a biennial survey conducted by the 
National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. 
The survey has been conducted since 1972 and is designed to gather data
on social trends and attitudes in the United States.
The GSS collects information on a wide range of topics, 
including race relations, gender roles, politics, and religion. 
The data is collected through face-to-face interviews with a nationally 
representative sample of adults in the United States.

The gss_clean dataframe provided in this lab contains data from the GSS, 
including information on respondents' 
sex, education, region, age, income, job prestige, and attitudes towards gender roles.
The data has been cleaned and processed for analysis, and includes a weight variable 
to adjust for sampling bias. This dataset provides a valuable source of information
for researchers and policymakers interested in understanding social trends in the
United States. 


## The Gender Wage Gap 

According to the Global Gender Gap Report by World Economic Forum in 2022, 
**_"Gender parity is not recovering, and It will take another 132 years to close 
the global gender gap_."** 
The gender wage gap is a well-documented phenomenon that refers to the difference 
in earnings between men and women for the same role and responsibilities. 
The most salient factors contributing to gender-based wealth inequity are gender 
pay gaps, unequal career progression trajectories, gender gaps in financial literacy, 
and life events that typically influence women's participation in paid work and their 
ability to contribute to wealth accumulation. Childcare-related life events have the 
greatest impact on gender wealth equity, with women accumulating only 74% of the
wealth of men on average after a 40-year career in comparable roles if they have 
a child to care for.

Despite high levels of female representation in certain industries, 
there remains a gender gap in leadership roles. In the Personal Services and
well-being industry, for instance, women account for 62% of the total workforce
but only 45% of leadership positions.

**Is the gender wage gap due to underperformance in leadership?**
As an analyst, I was motivated to investigate the relationship between political
leadership positions and their potential impact on a country's economy, 
given that these positions represent the highest level of achievement in this domain. 

The global average share of women in parliament rose to 22.9%, with Mexico (50%),
Nicaragua (50.6%), and Rwanda (61.3%) having the highest shares of women in parliament.
It is interesting that the countries Nicaragua and Rwanda recorded the highest
economic growth as a country over the past decade and reached the pinnacle 
last year with 17.70 and 20.06 respectively in their quarterly GDP Growth Rate.
